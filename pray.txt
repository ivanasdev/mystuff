gimme the force to holding on
gimme the reason for standing up

I woke
in the top
of the wall
is my fall
oh my god

you  given up
forever and more 

what can you give 
when I got enough 
what can you take 
if I lossing my blame

in my mind 
shes in cry 
shes my day 
shes inside 
ima prey 
for your smile  
a love of my life  
just love me and die
